⌘ EunjiTan.github.io // System Profile

A minimalist, cyberpunk-inspired personal landing page serving as the root directory for my digital presence.

📂 Description

This project acts as the primary entry point for my GitHub Pages portfolio. It eschews traditional "clean corporate" web design in favor of a terminal/holographic aesthetic that reflects my background in systems architecture, backend logic, and full-stack engineering.

The site is built to be lightweight, loading instantly with zero JavaScript dependencies for the UI rendering, relying solely on semantic HTML and advanced CSS3 styling for the visual effects.
